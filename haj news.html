        ISLAMABAD: At least 35 Pakistanis have lost their lives while performing Hajj this year due to extreme weather conditions, the Ministry of Religious Affairs confirmed on Thursday.
    </p>

<p>
    The death toll from this year's Hajj has exceeded 1,000, an AFP tally said on Thursday, more than half of them unregistered worshippers who performed the pilgrimage in extreme heat. </p>
<p>
    Fatalities have been reported by Egypt, Pakistan, India, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, Senegal, Tunisia, and Iraq.

</p>
<p>
    Director General of Pakistan's Hajj Mission Abdul Wahab Soomro said that as of 4pm on June 18, a total of 35 Pakistani deaths had been reported — 20 in Makkah, six in Madina, four in Mina, three in Arafat, and two in Muzdalifah </p>
<p>
    "Due to a temperature of 50°C, this was a tough Hajj," the official said </p>
<p>
    Soomro also dismissed social media claims of leaving the pilgrims "helpless". "We trust the Saudi government's information and we confirm it ourselves as well, whenever there's a death. We are informed."
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile, the ministry added that under the Saudi government's rules, they seek permission from the heirs of the family for burial. </p>
<p>
    "After bathing [the body], funeral prayers are offered here and burial takes place in Saudi Arabia." In case the family wants the body back, it said, arrangements are made to send it to Pakistan. </p>
<p>
    Media reports suggest that friends and family of missing Hajj pilgrims are searching hospitals and pleading online for news, fearing the worst.
</p><p> 
    The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must complete it at least once </p>
<p>
    Its timing is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, shifting forward each year in the Gregorian calendar </p>
<p>
    For the past several years the mainly outdoor rituals have fallen during the sweltering Saudi summer. </p>
