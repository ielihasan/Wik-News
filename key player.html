<div class="detail">
    <p>Pakistan is set to host Bangladesh in August for a two-Test series as Captain Shan Masood, head coach Jason
        Gillespie and the selection committee have begun discussions related to the squad, as revealed by the sources on
        Wednesday.
    </p>


    <p>
        However, some crucial players may miss the series.
    </p>

    <p>
        This will be the first time since 2019-2020 that the country will host Bangladesh. Moreover, the series will
        form a part of the ICC World Test Championship 2023-2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is likely that the current white-ball skipper Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afridi will be
        rested for the Test matches against Bangladesh whereas Haris Raufs inclusion in the squad is not even being
        considered.
    </p>
    <p>
        Saud Shakeel, Abdullah Shafique, Salman Ali Agha and former skipper and wicketkeeper-batter Sarfaraz Ahmed are
        being considered for the final squad.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the fast bowling department, Naseem Shah, Shahnawaz Dahani, Mir Hamza, Khurram Shahzad and Aamir Jamal
        are under consideration for selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        This series will be Gillespies first assignment as head coach of the Pakistan Test team after his appointment in
        April and Masoods second assignment after his appointment later last year. He first led the side against
        Australia in a three-Test series which Pakistan lost 3-0 in Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Masood is currently representing and captaining the Yorkshire County Cricket Club in the County Championship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pakistan were knocked out of the ongoing T20 World Cup in the initial group stage, whereas Bangladesh have
        qualified for the Super 8.
